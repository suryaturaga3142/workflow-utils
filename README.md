# workflow-utils

This place is going under a p big upgrade. I'll try keep this place updated with the utilities I use, but generally if it's a project related one (like a Makefile or scripts), you're better off looking at the project repo itself. Scripts are definitely updated more regularly there.

Unless it's the Cadence Virtuoso scripts. I can't keep Virtuoso work public but I made the scripts, so I can put them here. I'll update when I can. 

You'll have to wait for guides on how to use them, though. Just put it through AI and ask or something for now ig. I defo used AI help for some scripts.
