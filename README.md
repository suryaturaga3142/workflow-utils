# workflow-utils

I enjoy working on my own set of utilities that comprise my 'toolkit' to ease workflow. This repo has a couple of them for reference. I'll try update it with good commenting as I go along.

When faced with running many commands, it's easier to use Makefiles. When dealing with many files and copying over information, it's easier to make scripts. I don't overcomplicate my utilities, since scripting isn't my primary focus. I would say I know enough scripting and Makefile development to get by, and keep things simple enough to edit on the fly and also not forget the original tasks being carried out.
